1.While you’re in a gdb session, how do you set the arguments that will be passed to the program when it’s run?
	 Before you run your program, set the arguments using the set args  		command followed by the arguments you want to pass.EG:
	 "set args arg1 arg2".
2.How do you create a breakpoint?
	1.break filename:linenumber --set a breakpoint at a line
	2.break function-name -- set a breakpoint on function
	3.break [+|-] offset-number --set a breakpoint at sepcific offset from current line. 
	4.rbreak reg-expression--Set a breakpoint on all functions matching Regular Expression.
	5.break *instruction-address--Set a breakpoint on instruction address.
	6.break breakpoint condition--Set a conditional breakpoint.
